# google-homepage

A project putting to practice HTML and CSS basics to recreate the Google homepage (simple one with just a search box).

By the end I will have demonstrated how to:
    - Use HTML to create the structure of the page
    - Use CSS to style and make it look like the page
    - Apply responsive web design principles
    - use basic Git workflow to commit files
